# Summary
In this day and age, founders need to build their own brand. It makes marketing, sales and product management much easier. Leverage social media and other channels to expand your network of dream customers.
LinkedIn and Twitter should be the first one to try out. LinkedIn is great for B2B sales, and Twitter's strength lies in its speed and fast feedback. They both are home to early adopters, and you can use them for early validation.

# Chapters
##  Introduction
- The goal of marketing is to make sales easier. Building a founder's brand makes it effective.
- Marketing is all about understanding people, and while we know that people like to know other people, but knowing the founder gives another level of trust and power.
- The best time to build your audience is when your engineers and designers are building the product. This way, when they are ready to sell, you wouldn't have to do it cold.
- A founder with a brand gives your marketing efforts superpowers:
	- Trust: People want to buy from real people, not corporations. When the founder and brand coincide, people feel they're buying from a person they can trust.
	- Expertise: The founder has (should have?) deep expertise in the industry and people want to be led by an expert. 
	- Leadership: Every great movement has a leader. Founder has to be the spokesperson.
	- Content: Founder is an expert and often have the internal knowledge about the industry, market and the competition.
	- Personality: Founders often have some type of interesting personality trait, history, stories, and of course quirks. All of this can build an authentic brand.
	- Relationships: Founders have relationships with industry participants and get an incredible perspective. Founders are in so many interesting conversations each week, and all of that can build a brand by doing your work in public. Share commentary.
- Social media is the most powerful brand building tool ever created. You can bypass the whole traditional media if you use it well.
- Like a music album from an established artist, you company will be accepted more easily if founder already has a brand.
## Become a storyteller
- Anyone launching a business has a reason for doing it, and there is a story that can be shared.
- Founder story provides engaging content and context long before talking about any products or specs, and it works. Almost always, the founding story makes for great marketing content.
- Use following questions as your framework for building the story. The book has some good examples:
	- What is your founder's (your) backstory? You don't need to include every bit of your story, only the parts that connect in some way with your product.
	- What's the problem your business exists to solve?
	- what's the villain your customers are facing?
	- What is the solution that you offer?
	- What are the benefits of using your product?
	- What's life before and after using you product? One of the best things you can do in your marketing and storytelling is to actually show your customers what life is like before and after using your product.
- People want to work with you. The real you. Not the corporate you. Not the nameless, faceless company. So you need to actually put yourself in the story.
## Find your niche and define your enemy
- Finding a niche means you have a clear focus on your intended, targeted customer for today. The author focused their marketing efforts not on sales and lead generation, but simply on becoming the trusted expert and authority on product marketing.
- It all starts like this: define a niche, build an audience of people in that niche through your content( which gets people to know, like and trust you well before they are ready to buy from you), listen and learn from that audience and then design products and services that match those people's needs.
- On finding the niche, today is the keyword; thing about your present ideal customer, not the one based on the features and benefits and future products that you might be building.
- What if the niche is too small? It's rarely the case, and you will learn quickly if it is.
- Every story needs a villain. Sometimes, the status quo is the villain.
- It sounds like a story arch or mountain. You create an advantage in marketing when you create a villain. A villain allows you to tap into the art of storytelling, gives you a conflict, and allows for conflict resolution. You want your brand's product or service to be seen as the resolution to that struggle. You are here to save the day. Your brand exists to free your customer from this struggle. To relieve their pain. To solve their biggest problem and tackle that hairy challenge they haven't been able to solve without you.
- You can't fake this. It has to be a real, authentic part of your brand and story.
- Idea of working in public works as a brand. Most people are skeptical even though they agree with your villain, they often have't seen the solution yet. Show how you're attacking this villain by actually proving it.
- If you have a better way of doing things, show it. Document it: It's the best content for social media.
- Your villain must be obvious. When you talk about it, everyone in your niche should nod along like, "Yes! I have this problem too!"
- While defining your target customer, be as specific as possible. Don't day "women," say, "women, twenty five to thirty, college educated, living in the suburbs, not married, no children." You want a group small enough that you can get their attention, but big enough that they can reach out to others.
## Now you need an explainer
- Now you need to turn this story into a short, memorable statement, and explainer that can be used in actual conversations. Traditional positioning doesn't give you something you can use in a regular conversation. Think about all of those meetings with potential investors or current investors, industry events, or interviews and podcasts. If you don't have something you can easily and consistently use in those conversation your brand is belly-up, dying in the water already.
- One important copy writing lesson is "first line, second line". The goal of the first line of your copy should always be to get someone to read your second line of copy.
- An explainer should be two to three sentences long. The format:
	- You know how..............( insert the problem or old way of doing things that you aim to change)?
	- Instead of _________ ( problem/old way,) we have a ___ (solution/new way).
	- We call it __ (name of the product or brand).
- Some good examples are in the book.
## Find your role models, mentors, and anti-role models
- Steal ideas, the book is on creativity *steal like an artist*.
- Role Model: someone you look up to professionally, who has achieved what you want to achieve.
	- Ideally this is someone in your industry. You need to pick his brain. Search for his name on Spotify and Apple podcasts.
	- It's easier to follow the masses and just read broader industry news. You should identify a founder and follow their every move.
	- Following them on twitter isn't enough. Listen to every interview. Read everything they write or that's written about them.
	- Sometimes, your role model may not be a specific person; it may instead be a company, especially if the founder did not really publicize their process.
- Mentors: You watch a role model from distance, but you have a personal relationship with a mentor. This should be someone you can actually meet with regularly. Find someone in a similar industry. You want to find direct access to someone who has already done what you're trying to do.
- Anti-Role models: Anti-role model provides guidance as much as the role model does. You learn what *not* to do. Charlie Munger has an inversion formula. Reminded me of the famous meme from The Office: Dwight: Whenever I'm about to _do_ something, I _think_, "_Would_ an _idiot do_ that?" And if they _would_, I _do_ not _do_ that thing.
- History is the greatest teacher. Your role model in building your founder brand should be someone connected to what you aim to do.
- A famous person can't be your role model just because he is famous. Your role model is the founder in your niche who has built a successful brand and an audience online with it.
- Brainstorm a list of at least five people for each category and research about them. Listen to interview, podcasts where they appear. Once  you have your list and have learned from them, it's time to put together the pieces and become a publisher of your story in order to fully embrace the power of the founder brand.
## Become a publisher and get on social media
With social media, you now are your own publisher.
- People will not find you just because you, your explainer and your story is good. There is simply too much noise and information.
- 40000 on Twitter is a huge following for a tech brand.
- Building a social media following requires quality, consistency and frequency. It is not enough to jump in, tweet once a week from bathroom, and then complain about social media not working. You need to make the commitment, and it takes time.
- Author think the best marketing strategy for any startup in 2022 and beyond is to think about building a media company for your niche - not just "building a marketing team."
- In the context of business: social media allows you to reach your dream customers directly online. Earlier people depended on PR agencies, press, TV, Radio etc.
- Three keys to becoming a publisher as a founder:
	- Founders should be active and posting at least three to five times a week on social media, specifically on Twitter and LinkedIn.
	- Founders should start a podcast focused on their niche.
	- Founders should make public speaking a priority, whether or not they like it.
- Do not try to be everywhere. Twitter and LinkedIn give the most return on investment.
- It's OK to use your marketing team to do the posting on your behalf. But you, as the founder, must be person who does the responding to your followers, not your team. And you must be on social media to have your finger on the pulse of what people are saying.
- Most founders stink at social media. The bar is low. People are more likely to buy from brands that they know, like and trust. As the founder of the company, you are the face of the brand. Social media is your own PR channel. It is the "media arm" of your business.
- If you don't have time; make it. It doesn't need to be over 20 minutes in a day. Put it on the calendar. 
- Focus on brevity on Twitter and longer posts with story attached on LinkedIn.
## Twitter and LinkedIn
- We choose these platform because you can build an audience here solely based on the clarity of thoughts and writing them as text.
- These platforms provide you with instant feedback. So you can easily check if your targeting of your niche is working. Remember, the shorter the feedback loop is, the faster you learn.
- Twitter specifically, also is the home to "sneezers" (Seth Godin's term for early adopters) from most industries. The ones who have the authority and influence in your niche and are most likely to spread them message.
- Twitter feed is an ephemeral channel. Things don't last long. You can post once or ten times a day, and because of the way the twitter feed works, people don't get tired of seeing your stuff over and over, because there's a good chance they might not see it due to how fast the twitter moves. This should also lower the barrier for entry in your mind. Take the mindset that most people probably aren't even going to see what you write. So the purpose of posting is to find your voice first.
- LinkedIn is business Twitter.
- If you are a B2B, LinkedIn is the single most important platform you need to be spending your time on. Business content will reach more people that you care about than it will on Twitter.
- Every new connection is someone that opts in to see your content.
- Twitter gives you speed. Look at you popular posts on Twitter and then customize them for LinkedIn.
- Twitter performs better with more broad marketing topics for me, but LinkedIn performs better with very specific B2B marketing niches.
- For both platforms, again, write as you speak. Don't be overly formal. Your podcast voice should be similar to your writing voice.
- Short sentences are key! They are easier to understand, and they keep the attention of your audience. Overall, on social media, aim to have your sentences to be seven words or less.
- Respond to every single meaningful engagement you have, especially in the early days. People want to know that's really you there. It's called social media after all.
- Comments also expose your content and POV to other people you might now know and people who are not following you.
- Comments can also become the best content to post later on LinkedIn. I know if something is a popular comment, it will also be a popular post. And because most people haven't seen the comment, you will reach new people when you convert it to a post.
### Bios
- Make your profile visually engaging
	- Make you profile visually engaging. Get a good head shot.
	- Spend the design effort to make a professional banner. Twitter cover photo is 1500 x 500 pixels.
- For LinkedIn, write an interesting headline
	- Add social proof and credibility to your profile.
	- Your profile page is one of the most visited page about you. Experiment with it, take inspiration from others, always be changing and testing the copy here.
- Show your accomplishments on LinkedIn, not just where you worked and your title.
	- All of your investors, advisors, future customers, future employees, future partners - they are all on LinkedIn, and they want to see how credible your are too. Spend time on this
- Keep your Twitter bio short, simple and direct
	- There is no better way to attract like minded people than letting them know that's what I am thinking about too.
	- Consistency is one of the most important ingredients to building a following online.
	- Everyone has varied interest like eating, poetry, politics, sports or travel. But nobody is going to follow you for that. Focus on your niche. If you want a viral meme account, take a different approach, but this approach works for a founder who wants to get their message out to the world and build a brand.
- In Both, be a curator and do your work in public
	- Curating content is the easiest place to start when you're publishing on social media. You can talk about what's going on in your industry and staying up to date with trends. Let your audience know and feel that you are sharing tips and information with them that they can't find anywhere else.
	- You can build an audience without having to create "original" content.
	- Content curation in social media is the premise that you don't actually have to write or produce all of the content that you publish. Your audience should find it interesting but it should also serve your organization and your brand.
	- Start as a curator because it lowers the barrier for entry and success. And as a founder in a niche, you're most likely already in the middle of this content. You just need to take the next step and share it.
	- "Working in public" is a great way to share your authentic voice. You are going through a unique experience, so you have an original content.
	- Talk about what you are doing on a daily basis. You are part of the action in hiring, meeting, thinking about the roadmap. That is the best content you could share with people outside of your company. Reality TV is the best marketing strategy. Doing you work in public is the corporate form of reality TV. It's not edited or filtered.
	- Founders should not worry about creating new content each day on social media; instead, just document what happens each day. Talk about the meetings you had, what advisors suggested, and hints about things to come. Document, don't create. It's the best strategy founders could use to build brand online.
	- This, sharing your day, should be natural, not scripted.
	- Social media has a great way of attracting like minded people based on what you publish, and you use thing to your advantage by doing your work in public, or "documenting" what you're doing. It's about conveying expertise and providing value to your audience( and as a result, you build trust and earn followers in your niche).
### Principles for both Twitter and LinkedIn
- Become your industry's curator and do your work in public - these two principles increase your chance for becoming known as an expert in your field, the founder other people look to as a role model.
- Curating entails creating and re-posting industry news and trends from respected source.
- Work in public includes building, hiring and growth, but not just company stuff; include what you're reading, listening to, and watching. This working and living in public attracts like-minded people.
- Use commenting as a strategy. Reply to everyone, especially in the early days. You don't have to give long replies, but the simple act of acknowledgement by high five, fist bump or a quick word also goes a long way.
### Summary
- Find great and model great.
	- Be curious in your niche and find people worth following.
- Appearance matter.
	- Make sure to set your profile picture and cover photo
	- Use Twitter's pinned Tweet and LinkedIn's featured section to your advantage
- Focus on your topics
	- Define one or two core areas of focus, for example, startups and marketing
	- Personal stories about those areas of focus will captivate your followers. This is the "do your work in public" part.
- Two ways to get followers: education and entertainment
	- Most will try too hard to be entertaining - not a good fit.
	- Focus on education. Any founder can educate.
	- Edutainment is the holy grail, when you can both educate and entertain
- Show consistent clarity of thought. Great copy wins online.
- Compress ideas down into 280 characters for Twitter.
- Present in a quick and readable way; remember that everyone is scanning, and you want them to read your material.
- Be a contrarian. Be different. The feed is noisy. Strong opinions stand out.
- Consistency is key. Daily is when it will really take off.
- First, find your voice. Remember that the goal is not to build a following overnight. This will take time. Treat the first weeks and months as "Finding your voice" as opposed to worrying about how many followers you have. You need to learn what to say, how to say it, and what people are interested in. Be patient and publish regularly.
- Participate
	- You gotta be there. Respond yourself. Get a pulse of conversation in your industry. You will spend time there.
	- Comment and respond.
	- Always be curious. See what content is getting people talking. Be a consumer. It's tough to know what yo say if you're not regularly listening to others.
- You have to check every single day. Also, post every single day.
### Your turn
- Get Twitter visuals right
- Update your bios correctly, get inspiration from others
- Set a goal of posting every day for the next few weeks.
- Respond to everyone who comments, likes or shares your post.
- Post frequently, as you get familiar with the platform.
- Decide what time of the day you can dedicate to social media
## Podcast
- After social media, a podcast is the single best channel to build a brand as a founder today.
- Did not finish the chapter as it's not relevant for me right now.
## Hit the road
- Early to bed, early to rise, work like hell, and advertise - Ted Turner
- You must assume that people will not come to you. It's not enough to become a storyteller. You must be proactive about getting out there and telling that story to the world.
- The most overused quote in marketing come from the movie *field of dreams* but with opposite strategy: Just because you build it doesn't mean that people will come. You must go out and tell them to come.
- Accept every speaking opportunity you get in the first two years of building your brand. This is about "finding your voice".
- Wherever you start, always niche down. Think of it as training ground, not promotion. Cross promote your podcast.
- Imagine celebrities doing book tours. The hook, the reason they are doing a bunch of press or podcast interviews is because they have a new book out. But they don't spend the whole hour plugging the book.
## Become a master of the feedback loop
- One of the most powerful things in business and marketing today is the ability to get feedback directly from your dream customers without having to spend a dollar to earn their attention.
- Social media can transform you from a founder to a mini media company. Now you have the assets you need to create more marketing and provide air cover for your brand.
- Use feedback from  your audience to drive content ideas and product ideas.
- People who work in marketing at startups are often obsessed with time management and productivity. You can use such overlap to expand your reach.
- The same content can take many forms. You can even turn a collection of podcast interviews to a book!
- You carry your audience. And that's why you, and nobody else, has to do it.
- The relationship with your audience is market research.
- The real value of social media is not that it's a place to promote your stuff. It's a place to get feedback.
- Follower count is not a vanity metric but it's also not everything.
- If you have 10,000 Twitter followers, but not a single person comments on your tweet about your brand or new idea, I would say you don't have a list of dream customers following you.
