- You can save a lot of time and disappointment if you follow the advice in this book.
- **A complainer is not a customer**

## Intro
- Trying to learn from customer conversations is like excavating an archaeological site. The truth is down somewhere, but it's fragile. While each blow with your shovel gets you closer, you're liable to smash it into a million pieces if you use too blunt an instrument.
- The worst thing to believe is that we are on the right path when we are not.
- There is a big gap between textbook and checkbook.
## The Mom Test
- You shouldn't ask *anyone* whether your business is a good idea. It's a bad question, and most will lie at least a little to you to not hurt your feelings. The mom test is a set of simple rules for crafting good questions that even your mom can't lie to you about.
- The biggest improvement comes simply by not mentioning your idea.
- Rules:
	- Talks about their life instead of your idea
	- Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future
	- Talk less and listen more
- Opinions are worthless, unless coming from a deep industry expert.
- Would you buy a product which did “X”?: Anything involving the future is an over optimistic lie.
- Some problems don't actually matter. The solution is also trivial and customers are happy to live with it. Don't build your business fixing those issues.
- Watching someone to do a task will show you where issues and inefficiencies really are, not where the customer thinks they are.
- It's easy to get someone emotional about a concern if you lead them there. “Don't you hate when your shoelaces come untied while you are carrying groceries?”. “Yeah, that's the *worst*!” And then I go off and design my special never-come-untied laces without realizing that if you actually care, you would already be using a double-knot.
- Common wisdom is that you price your product in terms of value to the customer, rather cost to you.
- People stop lying when you ask them for money.
- While it's rare for someone to tell you precisely what they'll pay you, they'll often show you what it's worth to them.
- People want to help you. Give them an excuse to do so. Ask them for their domain and industry expertise.
- Asking customer questions does not mean building a product by committee. The creative vision is still yours.
- It boils down to this: you aren't allowed to tell them what their problem is, and in return, they aren't allowed to tell what to build. They own the problem, you own the solution.
## Avoiding Bad Data
- Three types of bad data:
	- Compliments
	- Fluff (Generics, hypotheticals, and the future)
	- Ideas
- Most meetings end with a compliment. You should just deflect the compliments and get on with the business of gathering facts and commitments.
- You are missing the signal if you are consistently saying:
	- That meeting went really well
	- we are getting a lot of positive feedback
	- Everybody I've talked to loves the idea
- Compliments are the fool's gold of customer learning: shiny, distracting and worthless.
- Fluff comes in three forms:
	- Generic claim (I usually, I always, I never)
	- Future tense promises (I would, I will)
	- Hypothetical maybes (I might, I could)
- Fluff always sounds so concrete. As a founder, you desperately want to believe it is money in the bank. But folks are wildly optimistic about what they would do in the future. They've always more positive, excited and willing to pay in the imagined future than they are once that future arrives.
- Anchor the fluff. Ask for the past examples when they did something like it. For example, if someone is complaining about the need to carry so many brand loyalty cards, ask whether they have ever looked for an alternative? A simple google search would tell about the apps that can store them. If they are not ready to google about a problem, chances are they will not use your solution too. **That person is a complainer, not a customer.** Don't try to convert them.
- Digging beneath Ideas. Startups don't starve, they drown. We have too many ideas, not too few.
- Ideas and feature requests should be understood, but not obeyed.
- Avoid approval seeking. If you have mentioned your idea, people will try to protect your feelings.
- Anyone will say your idea is great if you're annoying enough about it.
- The more you're talking in a customer meeting, the worse you are doing.
## Asking important Questions
- Search out the world rocking scary questions you have been unintentionally shrinking from. Imagine that the company has failed and ask why that happened. Then imagine it as a huge success and ask what had to be true to get there.
- You can tell it's an important question when its answer could completely change or disprove your business. If you get an unexpected answer to a question, and it doesn't affect what are doing, it wasn't a terribly significant question to begin with.
- For unpleasant tasks, you should imagine what you would have someone else do if you were delegating it. Then do that.
- Unless someone is holding a check, the only thing to gain from “convincing” them are false positives.
- Everyone has problems they know about, but don't actually care enough about to fix. And if you zoom-in too quickly and lead them to that semi-problem, they'll happily drown you in all the unimportant details. Zooming in too quickly on a super specific problem before you understand the rest of the customer's like can irreparably confuse your learnings. If someone is not going to the gym, the issue might be that at this point in their life, they don't think it's important. If you zoom-in wrongly, you might conclude that travel time is the issue, and a home gym is the solution.
- Marketing is always in the top 3 problems of a business.
- Two risks in the business:
	- Product risk—Can I build it? Can I grow it?
	- Customer/Market risk—Do they want it? Will they pay me? Are there lots of them?
- If you have got heavy product risk (as opposed to pure market risk), then you're not going to be able to prove as much of your business through conversations alone. The conversations give you a starting point, but you will have to start building product earlier and with less certainty than if you had pure market risk.
- Prepare your list of 3 big questions. When we go through an unplanned conversation, we tend to focus on trivial stuff that keeps the conversation comfortable.
## Keeping It Casual
- Learning about a customer and their problem works better as a quick and casual chat than a long, formal meeting.
- The meeting antipattern is the tendency to relegate every opportunity for customer conversation into a calendar block.
- Asking the right question is fast and touches on topics that people find quite interesting. At their best, these conversations are a pleasure for both parties, you're probably the first person in a long time to be truly interested in the petty annoyances of their day.
- If it feels like they're doing you a favor by talking to you, it's probably too formal.
- It only takes five minutes to learn whether a problem exists and is important.
- To keep it formal, and get maximum knowledge of the customer's problem, give as little information as possible about your idea while still nudging the discussion in a useful direction.
## Commitment and Advancement
- When you fail to push for advancement, you end up with zombie leads: potential customers (or investors) who keep taking meeting and saying nice things, but who never seem to cut a check. It's like your startup has been friend zoned.
- Commitment—They are showing they are serious by giving up something they value such as time, reputation, or money.
- Advancement—They are moving to the next step of your real world funnel and getting close to purchasing
- There is no such thing as a meeting which just “went well”. If you don't know what happen next after a product or sales meeting, the meeting was pointless.
- Having a compliment can still be useful, though—it's a warning flag that the person you are talking to is trying to get rid of you.
- A compliment plus a stalling tactic is the classic way to end a pitch for something you're never going to buy. If you've hit on a real problem, the customers jump at the chance to start making progress today and get early access.
- If you are selling anything to companies, you are going to have to talk to multiple people. If they don't introduce you, then it's a safe bet you are at a dead end.
### Crazy Customers and Your First Sale
- First customers are crazy. Crazy in a good way. They really, really want what you're making. 
- Keep an eye out for the people who get emotional about you're doing. They are the early evangelists who:
	- Have the problem
	- Know they have the problem
	- Have the budget to solve the problem
	- Have already cobbled together their own makeshift solution
- Firstly, when someone is not too emotional about what you're doing, they are unlikely to end up being one of your crazy customers. Keep them on the list.
- Secondly, whenever you see the deep emotion, do your utmost to keep that person close. They are ones who will commit before it makes rational sense to do, fight with their boss for you, buy your ugly prototype, and front you the money for pre-order.
## Finding Conversations
- The only thing people love talking about more than themselves is their problems.
- If you start a conversation with an excuse, treat it as one time learning instead of an ongoing relationship.
- If it's not a formal meeting, you don't need to make excuses about why you are there or even mention that you are starting a business. Just talk about their life.
- Make cold calls. if 98 out of 100 reject, it is still fine.
- Go to industry events, universities, investors, advisors asking for intros.
- Framing format **Vision/Framing/weakness/Pedestal/Ask**
	- You are an entrepreneur trying to solve X, don't mention your idea.
	- Frame expectations by mentioning the stage you're in. If you aren't selling, mention it.
	- Show weakness and give them a chance to help by mentioning X that you are looking for answers on. This will also clarify that you are not a time waster.
	- Put them on a pedestal by showing how much they, in particular, can help.
	- Explicitly ask for help.
- Meet in person
- You will keep learning, but within a week you should be able to answer almost any individual question about your business and customer.
- This stuff is fast. Don't spend a week prepping for meetings; spend an hour and then go talk to people. Anything more is stalling.
## Choosing your Customers
- When it comes to getting above water and making faster progress, good customer segmentation is your best friend.
- If you are not finding consistent problems and goals, you don't have a specific enough customer segment.
- Use customer slicing to find a concrete starting point. If there's not a clear physical or digital location at which can find your customer segment, then it's probably still too broad.
- It's worth picking customers you admire and enjoy being around. The stuff is hard work and can be a real grind if you are cynical about the people or industry you're trying to understand and serve.
- Good customer segments are a who-where pair. If you don't know where to go to find your customers, keep slicing your segment into small pieces until you do.
- Don't fall into the trap of only talking to the most senior, important people you can find. You want to talk to people who are representative of your customers.
## Running the process
- A common anti pattern is for the business guy to go to all the meetings and subsequently tell the rest of the team what they should do. Owning customer conversations creates a de-facto dictator with "The customer said so"  as the ultimate trump card.
### Prepping
- You need a list of your 3 big questions.
- Sit down with your whole founding team when you prep. You want both business and product to be represented. If you leave part of the company out of the prep, then you end up missing their concerns in the customer conversations.
### Reviewing
- The review again should involve most team.
- The conversations should be recorded in some easily searchable medium. Use a common language/terminology for your product and your notes.
- Use a shadow interviewer initially to observe and note-taking. He can also pitch in if the conversations start stalling or go off-topic.
- Confidence is domain specific, it gets better as we do more of it.
- You can also record the conversation for later reviewing.
### Process
- You are wasting time if you are not scared of the questions you are going to ask.
### The process before a batch of conversations:
- If you haven't yet, choose a focused, findable customer segment.
- With your team, decide your big 3 learning goals.
- If relevant, decide on ideal next steps and commitments.
- If conversations are the right tool, figure out who to talk to
- Create a series of best guesses about what the person cares about
- If a question could be answered via desk research, do that fast.
### During the conversation:
- Frame the conversation
- Keep it casual
- Ask good questions that pass The Mom Test
- Deflect compliments, anchor fluff, and dig beneath signals.
- Take good notes
- If relevant, press for commitment and next steps
### After a batch of conversations:
- With your team, review your notes and key customer quotes
- If relevant,transfer notes into permanent storage
- Update your beliefs and plans
- Decide on the next 3 big questions
